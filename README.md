📘 Student Record Management System

A simple Java console-based application designed to manage student records. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming, methods, constructors, arrays/ArrayList, and control structures, as required in the assignment.

📌 Features

✔ Add Student

Allows the user to enter student details:

Roll Number
Name
Course 4.Marks Automatically calculates the student's grade based on the marks.
✔ Display All Students Shows all student records in a clean, formatted view.

✔ Grade Calculation Grades are assigned as per the following logic:

A → Marks ≥ 90 B → Marks ≥ 75 C → Marks ≥ 60 D → Marks < 60

🧰 Technologies Used

Java (JDK 8 or above)
OOP Concepts
ArrayList for storing multiple records
Scanner for user input
Conditionals and Loops
